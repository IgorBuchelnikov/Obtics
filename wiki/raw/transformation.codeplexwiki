! transformation

A transformation in the context of Obtics means an object that takes an input [source] and from that [source] calculates an output. A transformation therefore is much like a function. The difference is that a function gives a one-time result and is never [reactive] or [observable] where a transformation can continualy update its output. A transformation object is usually the result of a function. 

Notably the transformation itself is a [static] object even though its output may be [volatile].

Multiple transformation objects may be chained to form a [transformation pipeline].
