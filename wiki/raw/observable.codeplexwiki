! Observable

An object is observable if it has the ability to notify users of the object of changes of its properties. An object needs to be observable so that clients can react to changes (be [reactive]) of its property values.

There are different styles of observability. Most common are implementing INotifyPropertyChanged, INotifyCollectionChanged (for collection objects) or DependencyObjects with dependency properties.
