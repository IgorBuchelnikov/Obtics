ObticsExamle is a simple demonstration application for the Obtics library.<br /><br />It mimics a simple shop that sells Products consisting of a number of Parts. These Products and Parts can be added, removed or edited using the application.<br /><br />There is a simple selling Daemon that every x number of seconds will try to sell a Product. Selling a Product means that a number of Parts will get subtracted from stock. When stock gets low and eventually runs out the color of the Parts and Products wil change from green to orange and red. Manually you can add new items to the stock.<br /><br />The application has a small domain model cosisting of a Shop object, Product, Part and ProductParts objects. The UI consists of a single XAML window and almost all interaction is created using Obtics.</div><div class="ClearBoth"></div>
