    "Description": "I've tracked down another bug related to a class that both inherits from the DependencyObject and implements INotifyPropertyChanged.  If I use ExpressionObserver on an Expression which references the property (which uses INotifyPropertyChanged) of a property (say which uses either INotifyPropertyChanged *or* DependencyProperty) on a DependencyObject that also implements INotifyPropertyChanged (say ObjectA) then any changes to PropertyB will not update the result of the ExpressionObserver.\nIf, however, I create a property wrapper to PropertyB (say PropertyC) directly on ObjectA (which means handling the property change event for PropertyB and assigning the new value to PropertyC and re-raising any change events direction on ObjectA), then the result from ExpressionObserver works as expected.\n \nHere it is as a code example:\nNot working:\n<code>\nFunction(source As ObjectA) _\n From model In source.Property1.Collection1 _\n Where source.PropertyA.PropertyB > model.Property2 _\n Select model _\n)\n</code>\n \nWorking:\n<code>\nFunction(source As ObjectA) _\n From model In source.Property1.Collection1 _\n Where source.PropertyC > model.Property2 _\n Select model _\n)\n</code>",
