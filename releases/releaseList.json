    "Description": "Obtics is a library that offers Functional Reactive Programming abilities to common .Net languages.\n\nThis version contains some small feature extensions and code improvements. The most important change is that this version runs under partial trust and most notably with limited reflection permissions. Running with limited reflection permissions does impose some limitations on the ExpressionObserver. Assuming that discovery of private types and members is not allowed the following limitations apply:\n\n# All members in the lambda expression passed to ExpressionObserver must be public.\n# Closures of local variables can not be used.\n# Anonymous types can not be used.\n\nBinding to interfaces (as returned by Obtics methods) in WPF also has limitations. When discovery of private types and members is not allowed; interface properties will need to be refered explicitly.\n\nThe RegexTool has been converted to an XBAP application to demonstrate the use of Obtics with limited priviliges.\n\nTwo projects have been added (ObticsUnitTestRunner and UnitTestStub) to allow execution of ObticsUnitTest tests under partial trust.\n\nAll libraries and some executables are now signed using the dev.snk key. Note that this key is *not secret* and you should sign the libraries with your own secret key before releasing a product.\n\nWhen downloading the binaries and running test.exe; the following parameters can be passed:\none or more of the numbers from 0 to 6 and 10 to 23\nspecifying a different test query.\nFor example:\ntest.exe 0 2 3\n\nCheck out source code for details.",

    "Description": "This release has quite a few changes. \n\n* The internal collection change propagation mechanism has changed. Internally only single item changes are handled. \n* IEnumerables that are results of Obtics transformation methods generally no longer support INotifyPropertyChanged. Only the results of ObservableEnumerable.ToList() and ObservableEnumerable.Cap(), both of which return IList objects and therefore have actually changing properties, support INotifyPropertyChanged.\n* ObservableEnumerable sorting methods no longer do a stable sort. That means that the original element order is no longer the final sorting criterium. Elements with an equal sorting key will appear in a random order in the result sequence.\n* Internally Obtics can use unordered sequences. It can do this when the final result does not depend on the original ordering of source sequence elements. Unordered sequences carry a lot less information (no index information) and are therefore a lot cheaper in resources. When creating complex queries on long source sequences, try to sort the end result for a performance boost. Equality comparison and hashing are very important for unordered sequences. Make sure all elements of your source sequences implement these properly.\n* ObticsRaytracer example has been optimized. Scene changes are processed much faster.\n\nWhen downloading the binaries and running test.exe; the following parameters can be passed:\none or more of the numbers from 0 to 6 and 10 to 23\nspecifying a different test query.\nFor example:\ntest.exe 0 2 3\n\nCheck out source code for details.\n",

Like Luke's code is not an example of how LINQ should be used; this is not an example of how obtics should be used! It was usefull just to prove that it can be done and for performance testing. It requires the parallel extension library and  the 'Debug - Parallel' or 'Release - Parallel' solution configuration needs to be used.\n\n[ObticsRaytracer] renders a 3d scene (builds it up out of transformation pipelines containing hundreds of transformation elements; that why it is slow!) and then changes the color and positions of the lights. The rendered scene is reactive to those changes and will reflect them automatically. The rendering and updating will be done on multiple cores if available.\n\nWhen downloading the binaries and running test.exe; the following parameters can be passed:\none or more of the numbers from 0 to 6 and 10 to 23\nspecifying a different test query.\nFor example:\ntest.exe i 0 2 3\n\nCheck out source code for details.\n",

    "Description": "Quite an overhaul of the ObservableEnumerable methods. They are now almost completely compatible with original Enumerable methods. This should not happen in a beta stage but it was too important. \nIt allowed a mechanism so that ExpressionObserver class can rewrite original non-observable object Linq queries into observable ones. This means it is no longer necessairy to replace System.Linq namespace with Obtics.Collections.ImplicitObservable to create observable linq queries.\n\nthe ObticsExaml project has been updated to reflect this possibility of rewriting standard object Linq queries into observable queries.\n\nFurther added many more unit tests and fixed some bugs with 'Cast', 'SequenceEquals' and expression rewriting.\n\nWhen downloading the binaries and running test.exe; the following parameters can be passed:\neither one of or both of 'e' (for explicitly observable queries) and 'i' (implicitly observable queries) and one or more of the numbers from 0 to 6 and 10 to 23\nspecifying a different test query.\nFor example:\ntest.exe i 0 2 3\n\nCheck out source code for details.",
